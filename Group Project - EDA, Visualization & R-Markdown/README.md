# Group Project: EDA, Visualization & R-Markdown

The following group project is a 4-member project where each group was assigned a department within Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) to indentify their business operations,
acquire and clean/transform the relevant data before executing basic EDA, and create 3 related visualizations. 

We were then tasked to produce 2 R-Markdown documents that generates a report in the format of a given template and an R-Markdown document that produces a powerpoint
presentation.
