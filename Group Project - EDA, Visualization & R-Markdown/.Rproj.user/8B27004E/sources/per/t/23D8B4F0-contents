# INTRODUCTION

The escalating concerns surrounding traffic violations necessitate an in-depth understanding of the patterns and trends associated with disciplinary summons. This research delves into a comprehensive data analysis conducted on a dataset obtained from the Security Department at the Northern University of Malaysia (UUM). The dataset, titled "Statistics Of Traffic Disciplinary Summons from Jan 2023 to Dec 2023," was meticulously examined by scrutinizing each attribute and record. The information gleaned from this dataset provides valuable insights into the disciplinary summonses issued, covering 20 types of traffic violations and spanning 118 records. The data collection process involved direct engagement with the security department, located near the UUM entrance, where a collaborative effort resulted in the acquisition of the dataset in early January 2024. The data file acquired from the department which was initially in a pdf file report, was then transformed into a csv format document by extracting the dataset therein in order to conduct the data analysis process.

The analytical focus of this research involved extracting three key pieces of information from the dataset to create insightful visualizations. The visualizations include a pie chart illustrating the "Distribution of Summons by Vehicle Category" based on four categories of vehicles: car, motorcycle, others, and not registered vehicles, a bar chart depicting the "Total Summons per Month," and another showcasing "Summons Total per Month (RM)". Through these visualizations, patterns and trends in traffic disciplinary summonses are unveiled, providing a foundation for informed decision-making. This paper presents the findings derived from the visualizations, highlighting significant observations such as the month with the highest and lowest total summons, the month with the highest summons total in RM, and the distribution of summons across vehicle categories.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The research elaborates a clear focus on the analysis and processing of data related to summons and total fines (RM) ranging for various vehicle categories across many monthly periods. The method used in this research applies an analytical approach to provide visual representations that include three key aspects: the total number of summons each month, the cumulative fines (RM) from summons per month, and the distribution of summons across different types of vehicle. This research offers a detailed investigation into the dynamics underpinning summon incidence and its total collected fines in the context of vehicle operations. The research aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the patterns inherent in the data by visualizing temporal trends in summon occurrence categorized by their type and time events, we are able to get a deeper understanding of the patterns and factors that contribute to these mistakes. This analysis allows us to identify any recurring patterns or common triggers for certain types of mistakes, enabling us to develop targeted strategies for prevention and improvement.

Furthermore, the research examines the dynamics of summons and fines in vehicle operations, utilizing analytical approaches to show temporal trends and mistake occurrence patterns. It classifies summons by time event per month, identifying recurring patterns and common triggers. The research additionally examines the distribution of summons across different vehicle categories to uncover potential systemic issues or performance disparities. The temporal dimension view enables the legal department to monitor changes in patterns over time, encouraging a proactive approach to the development of contingency plans and summons control across the campus area.
